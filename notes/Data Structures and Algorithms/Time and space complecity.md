# ⏱️ Time and Space Complexity (DSA – JavaScript)

## 📌 What Is Complexity?

**Algorithm complexity** measures the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of:

1. **Time Complexity** → How long it takes to run
2. **Space Complexity** → How much memory it uses

> Helps us choose the **most efficient solution** for a problem.

1. Big-O notation (O-notation)-Worst case complexity
2. Omega Notation - Best case complexity
3. Theta Notation - Aavarege case complexity
