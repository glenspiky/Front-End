# 📘 What Is an Algorithm (DSA – JavaScript)

> An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## 📌 Definition

> An **algorithm** is a set of **well-defined instructions** to solve a particular **problem**.

> In simple terms:  
> **Algorithm = clear instructions → correct output**

## 🎯 Why Algorithms Matter in DSA

- Solve problems efficiently
- Improve performance (time & memory)
- Used in interviews, competitive programming, and real-world apps
- Foundation of Data Structures

## 🧠 Key Characteristics of an Algorithm

1. **Input** – Takes zero or more inputs
2. **Output** – Produces at least one output
3. **Definiteness** – Steps are clear and unambiguous
4. **Finiteness** – Terminates after a finite number of steps
5. **Effectiveness** – Each step is simple and executable

## 🛠️ Basic Algorithm Structure (JavaScript)

```js
function algorithmName(input) {
  // step 1
  // step 2
  // step 3
  return output;
}
```
